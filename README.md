## Introduction:

 - The Guru99 Bank project aims to provide net banking facility to its customers.
 - This release will have limited features. Over a period of time , new and new functionalities will be added to the site.
    
 ### 1.1 Project Objective
 
  - We need to raise the trust in the quality of the project as high as possible before releasing it to customers.
  - Application under test:https://demo.guru99.com/V4/index.php.
  - Documentation:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rPW5DV82VJT6vtA1VDSrfxaCBuAduxW0zb1yfTh_VMk/edit.

 ### 1.2 Functionalities in scope

  - To ensure that new customers can successfully register and access the Guru99 Bank services
  - Functional testing & external interfaces are in scope and need to be tested
  - The banking site will be only compatible with Chrome version 27 and above
  - Here we should write all the functionalities that are included in the release.
  - Testing the functionalities related to account management, including account creation, updating, and deletion.
   
 ### 1.3 Functionalities and tests out of scope

  - Non-functional testing like stress, performance is beyond scope of this project.
  - Automation testing is beyond scope.
  - No QA support for mobile applications developed. Only web applications will be tested.

## 2.Test process:

 ### 2.1 Test planning
  
   Roles and responsibilities:

| Ramona - Tester  | will test: Edit customer,Security testing,Performance testing. |    
| :-----: | :---: | 
| Andreea - Senior Tester | will test: Create new customer,System testing,Delete customer. |   

   Entry criteria:
   
  - smoke test passed (being the most basic type of test, this is a very important entry criteria in the process of testing). 
  - testing environment is up and running.
  - Valid test data for creating a new customer is available, including name, address, phone number, and email.
  - roles needed for the project are allocated.
  - functional specifications are defined.
  - The necessary equipment and software are installed for testing.
  - Test scenarios and test cases for the 'New Customer,' 'Edit Customer,' and 'Delete Customer' functionalities are defined and documented.

   Exit criteria:
   
  - 90% of tests are passed
  - To generate a unique account number and authentication data for the new customer.
  - To provide a confirmation message of successful registration.
  - To correctly validate the user-entered data and provide error messages in case of errors.
  - To provide a detailed record of the test and the obtained results.
  - exploratory testing was performed on New customer module.
  - The customer deletion operation allows the successful removal of customers from the system.
  - After deletion, there are no unwanted references or leftover data in the system.
  - The system provides a confirmation or success message after a customer is successfully deleted.
  - In the case of a failed deletion, the system provides appropriate and detailed error messages.
  - All test recording data and their results are adequately documented.
  - Exploratory testing was conducted for the "Delete Customer" functionality to identify unexpected or unaddressed issues in the planned test cases.
  - The customer modification operation allows the successful modification of customer data in the system.
  - After modification, customer data is updated correctly and consistently throughout the entire system.
  - The system provides a confirmation or success message after the customer's data is successfully modified.
  - In the case of a failed modification, the system provides appropriate and detailed error messages.
  - All test recording data and their results are adequately documented.
  - Exploratory testing was conducted for the "Edit Customer" functionality to identify unexpected or unaddressed issues in the planned test cases.
      
   Risks:

  - stability risks (crashes, disconnects, etc)
  - IE browser might have performance issues
  - the web page pagination could be impacted when opened on mobile devices
  - stress conditions might impact the web application
  - new browser might not be supported
  - human error 
  - Data validation errors

 ### 2.2 Test analysis

  - Analyze the business requirements to make sure that we have all the details for creating the test conditions.
  - We plan on running a full regression test on the current version.
  - Write test conditions(What?)
  - Analyze the boundary conditions and limits for each functionality. For example, what happens when a customer record is at its data limit?
  - Identify the functional requirements for each functionality, including what data can be modified, what data can be deleted, and what new customer data can be added.
